Opuz
=====
OpenGL puzzle game.

Small game developped in a couple of days to test my libraries.

Important note:
---------------

I use special fonts that maybe not available on your system,
I have to improve font handling in GOLib to use fallback ones if not found.

Fonts are:
- Rothenburg Decorative
- Orange Juice
