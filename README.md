Opuz
=====
**Opuz** is the contration of **Opus** and **Puzzle**. It's a small puzzle game developped in a couple of days to test my libraries, but I have to admit puzzle game programming is a recurent test of mine when testing new framework.
(So I'm maybe now, the fastest puzzle game maker in the world :smiley: )

###Building from sources

```
git clone https://github.com/jpbruyere/Opuz.git   	# Download sources
cd Opuz
git submodule update --init --recursive             # Get submodules
xbuild  /p:Configuration=Release Opuz2015.sln       # Build
```
The resulting executable will be in **build/Release**.
